# HitshoAutomation

HitshoAutomation is a feature-rich extension designed for Mewt Sniper, offering a wide range of useful commands (50+) in addition to the existing ones.

Before running this extension, ensure you have installed the latest Python version from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Next, open Command Prompt and execute the following command: pip install psutil robloxapi pyautogui pillow. This will install the required dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, simply drag the "HitshoAutomation" folder into your Mewt Sniper directory and run it. The extension will automatically initiate Mewt Sniper.
